###  Background

Section 937(Â£) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), as amended by section 6301(b) of the Affordable Care Act of2010 (ACA), PL 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (March 23, 2010), authorizes the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide for the coordination of relevant Federal programs to build data capacity for patient-centered outcomes research. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) is delegated to coordinate the Department's effort.

The current project, titled Harmonization of Various Common Data Models and Open Standards for Evidence Generation, is a multiagency collaboration led by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Other agencies include the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the National Libraries of Medicine (NLM).

The purpose of this project is to provide patient-centered outcomes researchers with access to broader observational data by leveraging existing PCORTF investments such as US-Core, Data Access Framework (DAF) Research Implementation Guide (IG).
